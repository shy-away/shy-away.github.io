        <h1>Welcome to my portfolio website!</h1>

        <p>Hey, I'm Clark Prokop! I'm an Information Systems graduate with strong fundamentals, ready to learn anything.</p>

        <!-- About section -->
        <p>My name is Clark Prokop, and I have a passion for learning just about anything I can get my hands on. I graduated as an Information Systems major in 2023, with strong programming fundamentals in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java, with some experience in SQL and Python. I'm also proficient in Microsoft Excel, for which alongside HTML/CSS/JS, I was a tutor. Since graduation, I've kept up my skills and exposed myself to many other languages and technologies, such as Git (via CLI, with GitHub), Node.js, Express, React.js, MongoDB (with Mongoose), and C#. As a relative beginner in the field with <a href="#">exceptional potential</a>, I'm ready to employ, acquire, and hone my skills in just about any software development role.</p>
